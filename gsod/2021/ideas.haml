            %h3 About Performance Co-Pilot
            %p
              Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is an open-source distributed
              system performance analysis toolkit.
              It efficiently collects metrics from multiple systems and
              provides a variety of web, graphical and console tools for
              analysis of live and historical data.
            %p
              The suite begun production use over 20 years ago primarily
              in the High Performance Computing arena, however its
              customizable and lightweight design has proven popular on
              everything from tiny system-on-a-chip machines through to
              vast databases and number-crunching super computers.
              It is included in all Linux distributions and has an active
              base of users and developers.
            %p
              Writers interested in contributing to the project described
              here are encouraged to contact the volunteers listed below,

                  Three volunteers have come forward to assist once again - a
                  PCP maintainer, a developer and a documentation specialist -
                  all of whom volunteered last year as well.

          %h3 About Task-based Guides
        %div{:class => 'row'}
          %p
            In our previous Google Season of Docs project, we converted
            two freely-available books (the "Users and Administrators Guide"
            and the "Programmers Guide") into
            %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'} pcp.readthedocs.io
            content.
            We also extended this documentation with a new REST API guide,
            and made many other improvements.
          %p
            However, due to the many available tools, daemons, integrations
            and APIs we still find a high barrier to entry for new PCP
            users.
          %p
            It is this we plan to tackle next with our writer - curating a
            new series of focussed, task-oriented "How To" guides that will
            assist new users in engaging immediately, by clearly showing
            how to solve specific problem scenarios that users encounter
            frequently.
          %p
            The goals of the project are this to assist first-time users to
            become more productive right away, while also increasing traffic
            to the more detailed books in the same location (readthedocs.io).
            We plan to undertake this project over three months.

          %h4 The Task-based Guides project will:
          %p
            Pair developers with the writer to produce succinct step-by-step
            recipes showing how to perform certain tasks with PCP.
          %p
            Task-based topics include:

                    %li List the available performance metrics?
                    %li Add new metrics to the available set?

                      tool?
                    %li Export metric values in a comma-separated format?

          %p
            Additionally, the writer will:
          %ul
            %li
              Canvas the community for additional topics beyond the
              set above to produce an initial set of high-value guides
            %li
              Provide feedback to developers about potential areas of
              improvements in the tools to create more satisfying early
              user experiences.
            %li
              Audit existing documentation for tutorial content to add
              into the new
              %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'} readthedocs
              guide format.
              This involves an assessment of the existing
              %a{:href => 'https://pcp.io/documentation.html'} Short Guides
              and refactoring these into the
              %strong "How do I..."
              form.
            %li
              Introduce consistency into all Tutorials and Guides
              across the project, by using a single readthedocs.io
              landing page for all guides (same location, format,
              look-and-feel).

            %strong Work that is out-of-scope for this project:
          %p
            This project will focus on core PCP functionality,
            and not on integration with (for example) 3rd party
            sources of metrics, or sending PCP metrics to other
            analysis systems.

            %h3 Measuring Success
            %p
              We anticipate the How To pages will provide a better suited
              entry point for both new and some existing users.
              We will measure this by first enabling
              %a{:href => 'https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/google-analytics.html'} Google analytics
              on our readthedocs pages to begin tracking page accesses.
            %p
              %strong Success will be indicated by:
            %ul
              %li
                The largest number of hits to documentation pages being to the
                new Task-based Guides pages (we expect greater than double any
                other books as a measure of success).
                This success measure will be presented as a graph showing the
                spread of hits, with the most being attributed to the new
                Task-based Guides.
              %li
                A correlated increase in the number of hits to the existing
                PCP documentation - the
                %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/UAG/AboutUserAdministratorsGuide.html'} Users Guide ,
                %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/PG/AboutProgrammersGuide.html'} Programmers Guide
                and
                %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/'} REST API Guide
                as a result of the new (shorter, focussed) guides.
                We aim for a 20% increase in access to the other Guides as our
                success measure.
              %li
                Some guides will be in different forms - video-based vs text -
                we'll also use the analytics to determine which formats are
                more successful than others.
                This will be presented as a graph also; simply having this
                breakdown will indicate success to us, we can use that
                information to decide future documentation styles to prefer.
